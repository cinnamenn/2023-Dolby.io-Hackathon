**description**

The topic of Dolby 2023 hackathon is design a social good product that benefits the largest number of people in the most impactful way. The design is mainly aiming to improve the gender equity by providing a domestic violence report platform. 

**idea**

Safe Order is the webpage that helps domestic violence victims to make a call secretly to report their situation
as lots of victims find it hard to reach out for help as the abuser always nearby them.
The poject is inspired by the "911 fake pizza order", the pizza website is the blindfold that victims pretend
to order the pizza but actually making secret call. We are using Dolby communication API to provide the clear calling between users and operators.

  />

**4. phone call**

The operator will reach out the users by the providing detail from the ordering. (e.g. there was technical issue so the order didn't completed) The call is made as the operator can confrim the current situation of the victim, such as "is the utensils needed -> is the abuser with the weapons."
